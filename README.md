# arbitrary_transform
## Purpose
I wanted to demonstrate why some MIDI files still sound like they have lyrics. Any periodic signal can be represented as a superposition of sine waves, thus it should be theoretically possible to represent a sine wave as a superposition of any periodic signal [citation needed]. This is the code I'm working on for that.
