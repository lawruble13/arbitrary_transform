# Arbitrary Transform

## Purpose
I wanted to demonstrate why some MIDI files still sound like they have lyrics. Any periodic signal can be represented as a superposition of sine waves, thus it should be theoretically possible to represent a sine wave as a superposition of any signal satisfying certain properties. This is the code I'm working on for that. Effectively, this is a particular wavelet transform.
